::: {.callout-note}
## Try it out now!
The model is already deployed, check it out [here!](https://spam-detection.herokuapp.com/)

You can visit the repository of the project [here](https://github.com/alejandro77palacios/spam_detection).

You just need to input the text of the sms, whereupon the model outputs a prediction (spam or ham) along with the probability that it is true.

I created this project using Django and Heroku. Thanks to this, the code is modular, easy to read and, above all, to maintain.

The data for training is publicly available online.
